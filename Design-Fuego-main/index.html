    <!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The  image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are workinherog with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

Bad design are products which has confounding and confusing proccesses for the end user. While bad design is hard to find in the world, Apple is a very good example of what good design is. Apple products are made for a technology incompatant person to navigate their system them selves. A design priciple a tend to fallow is how would a child interface with this system, is it simple enough for anyone to understand.</h3>
